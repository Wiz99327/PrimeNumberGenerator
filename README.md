# PrimeNumberGenerator
This repository contains my implementation of the PrimeNumberGenerator exercise in both C# and Java.
Visual Studio was used to author the project in C#.  Eclipse was used to author the project in Java.
Both projects may be opened and built in their respective IDEs. Unit tests are included for each implmentation and cover all code paths.
